# ZestGMML #

ZestGMML is a simple Eclipse plug-in. Its goal is to support visualizing XGMML simply and easily in Eclipse.

## Development ##

If you want to check this out and beat it around, note that it depends on xg2d (another repo in my account). If you checkout xg2d and mvn install it, then when you mvn install ZestGMML it will find xg2d in your local Maven repo.
